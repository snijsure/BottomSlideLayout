# BottomSlideLayout
Sample Android app that shows how to implement a layout that slide from bottom. 
Seems like lot of map based applications CityMapper, FourSquare, Lonely Planet guides
app use these types of layout. YMMV

I had posted question on stackoverflow if something like this can be achived using 
stock BottomSheet , which doesn't support this functoinality.
